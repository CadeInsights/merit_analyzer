# Code Patterns
- Don't do defensive programming. Try-catch are acceptible only after getting approval from the user.
- Don't spam with helpers.
- Follow OOP and DRY.
- Keep code short. Smaller is better.

# Tools
- use 'uv' instead of 'pip' for package management
    - 'uv add toolname' instead of 'pip install toolname'
    - 'uv run script' instad of 'python script' or 'script'
